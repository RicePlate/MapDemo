# MapDemo

Simple web application to demonstrate full-stack development


There are a variety of frameworks for building webapps these days,
and since I have no idea about building these things (I'm a systems hacker),
I decided to investigate django, flask, node, and rails all at once.



All that's really needed is a simple http server with the following routes:

 - /view  -- view a map or all maps
 - /login -- user login
 - /createuser -- create a new user
 - /add   -- add a map
 - /mark  -- add a marker + info to map
 - /edit  -- update map
 - /delete -- delete a map
